				<h2>About Us</h2>
				<div className="about-us">
					<p>
						At EduCollabHub, we believe in the transformative power of
						collective intelligence, where students from diverse backgrounds
						converge to shape the future of education. Our platform is designed
						to foster a global community of learners, empowering individuals to
						share, discover, and collaborate on authentic educational content.
					</p>
					<p>
						Led by subject matter experts, we ensure the reliability of
						materials, creating a trustworthy space for academic enrichment.
						Join us on this educational journey where innovation meets
						collaboration. EduCollabHub is more than a platform; it's a dynamic
						space where your ideas and contributions shape the landscape of
						learning. Let's collaborate, learn, and inspire together at
						EduCollabHub!
					</p>

					<p>
						In the dynamic landscape of education, the advent of digital
						platforms has redefined the way students engage with learning
						materials. Recognizing the need for a collaborative and innovative
						space, we endeavor to create a comprehensive online platform that
						facilitates the seamless exchange of educational content among
						students.{" "}
					</p>

					<p>
						This initiative aims to harness the collective knowledge of the
						student community by enabling the creation, sharing, and evaluation
						of diverse learning resources in the forms of videos, pictures,
						text, and audio. As students navigate through their academic
						journeys, the abundance of information available can be
						overwhelming. EduCollabHub seeks to address this challenge by
						providing a curated space where subject matter experts authenticate
						and validate the educational material before it is shared with the
						wider community.{" "}
					</p>

					<p>
						This not only ensures the credibility of the content but also
						fosters a trustworthy environment for collaborative learning. The
						platform goes beyond traditional modes of learning by incorporating
						interactive features such as upvoting, downvoting, and commenting on
						posts.{" "}
					</p>

					<p>
						This not only allows users to express their opinions on the quality
						of content but also encourages meaningful discussions and
						knowledge-sharing within the community. To enhance the user
						experience, content is organized into categories, making it easier
						for students to discover relevant materials aligned with their
						academic interests.
					</p>

					<p>
						Through EduCollabHub, we envision a global network of students
						collaboratively contributing to a repository of authentic and
						diverse educational resources.{" "}
