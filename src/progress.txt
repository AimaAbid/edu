i spent time in ui
well i used a sidebar but its too complex i have an idea collapse component from bootstrap might work
also i think i need to use bootstrap elemeemts innovatively so whenevr u need anything in ui just search bootstrap and think which element can be used i feel it has all the answers

6/7
ui peh bohat time laggaya but i am proud kuch naya sikha ki bootstrap mai innovatively combine karsakte hai jaise maine list aur collapse ko combine kiya i feel like a front end developer now yeahhhhhhhhh:)
ab dekho backend mai course related schema kaise banana hai.....pehle socho help b lo j sai
